    <section id="intro">
        <p>My long-term career goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to advance neuroscience research. I have a solid background in ML/AI and over 10 years of experience across both academia and industry. In my doctoral research, I spearheaded a multi-lab project analyzing brain-wide activity in larval zebrafish (Chen et al., 2018). As Data Science lead at a biotech startup, I developed automated pipelines for precision cell manufacturing. At Amazon Alexa AI, I enhanced device and cloud-based deep learning models for Alexa Guard, implemented across Echo devices and Astro robots. I collaborated with engineering teams to refine science infrastructure and automation workflows, and led science initiatives for production features with cross-functional team coordination. I have also performed Machine Learning research in acoustic event detection and filed US patents on my work at Amazon. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I embraced the opportunity to share my knowledge and experiences through teaching. I have taught graduate-level classes on AI and data vizualization at Northeastern University as a part-time lecturer. With my recent transition to Yale, I teach courses on AI applications with the Computer Science Department both at the graduate and undergraduate level, and perform computational genomics research in the Neuroscience Department.</p>
