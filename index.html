    <section id="intro">
        <p>My long-term career goal is to leverage artificial intelligence to advance neuroscience research. I have a
            solid background in ML/AI and over 10 years of experience across both academia and industry. In my doctoral
            research, I spearheaded a multi-lab project analyzing brain-wide activity in larval zebrafish (<a href="https://dmg5c1valy4me.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/25141558/1-s2.0-S0896627318308444-main.pdf">Chen et al., 2018</a>
            ). As Data Science lead at a biotech startup, I developed automated pipelines for precision cell
            manufacturing. As a Research Scientist at Amazon Alexa AI, I enhanced device and cloud-based deep learning models for Alexa Guard,
            implemented across Echo devices and Astro robots. I collaborated with engineering teams to refine science
            infrastructure and automation workflows, and led science initiatives for production features with
            cross-functional team coordination. I have also performed Machine Learning research in acoustic event
            detection and filed US patents on my work at Amazon. </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I embraced the opportunity to share my knowledge and experiences through teaching. I have taught
            graduate-level classes on AI and data vizualization at Northeastern University as a part-time lecturer. With
            my recent transition to Yale, I teach courses on AI applications with the Computer Science Department both
            at the graduate and undergraduate level, and perform research on connectomics with the <a href="https://www.kuanlab.org/">Kuan Lab</a> in the Neuroscience
            Department.</p>
